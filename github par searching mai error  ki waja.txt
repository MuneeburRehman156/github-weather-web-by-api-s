The error you're encountering, "undefined", typically indicates that the element with the id 'show' is not found in the document.

This could be due to a few reasons:

The element with the id 'show' might not exist in your HTML markup.
The JavaScript code is executed before the HTML elements are loaded onto the page.
To resolve this issue, you can ensure that the JavaScript code runs after the DOM (Document Object Model) is fully loaded. You can achieve this by wrapping your JavaScript code in an event listener that listens for the 'DOMContentLoaded' event, which fires when the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed, without waiting for stylesheets, images, and subframes to finish loading.
